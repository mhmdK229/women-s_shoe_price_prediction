# women-s_shoe_price_prediction
This project predicts womenâ€™s shoe prices on eBay by preparing and engineering data features and training a model. Key steps include:

Data Preparation: Loaded, cleaned, and split data for training, tuning, and validation.

Feature Engineering: Created new features from product details and text, including significant keywords and title sentiment.

Model Training and Tuning: Used cross-validation and grid search to optimize an XGBoost model, compared it with a baseline linear model, and evaluated predictions using RMSE.

The final model provides accurate price forecasts by combining structured data and insights from product titles.
